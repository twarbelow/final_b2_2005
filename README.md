# BEM2 Final Technical Assessment
​
## Description
Field Trip is an app that allows a user to see airlines, flights, and passengers. Airlines have many flights, and flights belong to an airline. Flights have many passengers and passengers can have many flights. Make sure to read all instructions, tasks, and user stories before getting started. Model testing for relationships and any class methods is required, you do not need to test for validations.
​
## Instructions
​
* Work on this assessment independently. DO NOT discuss with anyone.
* Fork the assessment repository
* Clone your fork
* Run `bundle`
* Run `rake db:create`
* Complete the stories below
* Commit Frequently (at least every 10-15 minutes)
* Push your code to your fork once the time is up (not before!)
​
## Database information
* Airlines have a name
 (Ex: Airline.create(name: “Frontier”))
* Flights have a number, date, time, departure city, and arrival city
 (Ex: Flight.create(number: “1727”, date: “08/03/20”, departure_city: “Denver”, arrival_city: “Reno”)) -- for this app, it does not matter how you format the flight’s date
* Passengers have a name and age
 (Ex: Passenger.create(name: “Joe”, age: 7))

As a visitor
When I visit a flights show page
I see all of that flights information including:

​
As a visitor
When I visit a passengers show page
I see that passengers name
And I see a section of the page that displays all flight numbers of the flights for that passenger
All flight numbers are links to that flight’s show page

User Story 3, Assign a Passenger to a Flight
​
As a visitor
When I visit a passengers show page
I see a form to add a flight
When I fill in the form with a flight number (assuming these will always be unique)
And click submit
I'm taken back to the passengers show page
And I can see the flight number of the flight I just added
```
